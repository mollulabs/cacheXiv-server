# cacheXiv-server
Note: cacheXiv is not a mirror repository of arXiv.
- cacheXiv only works as an HTTP proxy.
- cacheXiv does not store any original material from arXiv.
- cacheXiv works through the Cloudflare Worker and may use different sources than the version published in the github repository.
- The official server: https://cachexiv.mollu.space may be inaccessible due to daily quota restrictions(100,000 a day). Another option is to build your own server.
